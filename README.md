# JourneyToTheFFT
A blog about my journey to learn Fourier algorithms and eventually implementing the FFT

1. Correlation function by integration

2. Cross Correlation

3. Integral Transform

4. Convolution algorithm

5. The Fourier Series and its Motivations

6. Complex numbers, complex exponentials, and complex integrals

  I always found it difficult to understand mathematics without a visual representation of what
  my calculations were doing in a geometric sense.  Especially in engineering mathematics, many
  concepts have a very useful visual representation and I really wanted to explore complex numbers in this visual fashion.  It is not commonly taught this way in the university classroom, and I always felt that complex numbers were a mystery to me beyond simply memorizing Euler's formula and its identities.  

  It's kind of a "see it to believe it" syndrome that I have, and I feel like many other people feel.  I can't stress how eye-opening the 3blue1brown videos were to my understanding of complex numbers.

  Really weird stuff happens with complex numbers when you perform simple operations on them.
