# JourneyToTheFFT
A blog about my journey to learning Fourier algorithms and eventually implementing the FFT

1. Correlation function by integration

2. Cross Correlation

3. Integral Transform

4. Convolution algorithm

5. The Fourier Series and its Motivations

6. Fourier Series to Fourier Transform
